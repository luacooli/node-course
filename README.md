# Node Course by udemy

To start the project, you need to have installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version >=12)
- Npm (comes with node.js installation)
- postman-request or axios

## Goals

Learning how to code in JavaScript and Node.js. Additionally, I challenged myself to use axios requests in addition to postman-request from the weather app chapter

## Project structure

The project is divided into several folders from all exercises of the course. Before start any project run:

```
bash
npm i
```

To see how each exercise works and its solution, go to the corresponding folder in this repository by

```
bash
cd 'folder-name'
```

Then run the server using the command below:

```
bash
node app.js
```
